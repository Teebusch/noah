noah (*no animals were harmed*) generates pseudonyms that are 
delightful and easy to remember. It creates adorable anonymous animals 
like the *Likeable Leech* and the *Proud Chickadee*.

## Installation

You can install noah from [Github](/https://github.com/teebusch/noah) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("teebusch/noah")
```

## Usage

### Generating pseudonyms

Use `pseudonymize()` to generate a unique pseudonyms for every unique
element / row in a vectors or data frame. 
`pseudonymize()` accepts multiple vectors and data frames as arguments, 
and will pseudonymize them row by row. 

```{r}
library(noah)

pseudonymize(1:9)

pseudonymize(
  c("🐰", "🐰", "🐰"), 
  c("🥕", "🥕", "🍰")
)
```

### Adding pseudonyms to data frames

In this example we use the diabetic retinopathy dataset from the package 
`survival` and add a new column with a pseudonym for each unique id. 
There are two ways to do this with noah:

#### Using `pseudonymize()`

Here we use `pseudonymize()` with `dplyr::mutate()`. 
We also use relocate to move the pseudonyms to the first column:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
diabetic <- as_tibble(survival::diabetic)

diabetic %>% 
  mutate(pseudonym = pseudonymize(id)) %>% 
  relocate(pseudonym)
```

#### Using `add_pseudonyms()`

`add_pseudonyms()` wraps `mutate()` and `relocate()`. It also supports
[tidyselect](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/language.html)
syntax for selecting the key columns:

```{r}
diabetic %>% 
  add_pseudonyms(id, where(is.factor))
```

### Keeping track of pseudonyms with an `Ark`

To make sure that all pseudonyms are unique and consistent, `pseudonymize()` and 
`add_pseudonyms()` use an object of class `Ark` (a pseudonym archive) 
By default, a new `Ark` gets created implicitly for each function call, 
but we can also provide an `Ark` ourselves, to keep track of the pseudonyms 
that have been used and make sure that the same keys always get assigned the 
same pseudonym:

```{r example-ark}
ark <- Ark$new()

# split dataset into left and right eye and pseudonymize separately
diabetic_left <- diabetic %>% 
  filter(eye == "left") %>% 
  add_pseudonyms(id, .ark = ark)

diabetic_right <- diabetic %>% 
  filter(eye == "right") %>% 
  add_pseudonyms(id, .ark = ark)

# reunite the data sets again
bind_rows(diabetic_left, diabetic_right) %>% 
  arrange(id)
```

The ark now contains `r length(ark)` pseudonyms -- as many as there are unique 
id's in the dataset.

```{r}
length(unique(diabetic$id))
length(ark)
```

### Making an alliterating Ark

For extra delight, we can also configure an `Ark` so that it generates only 
alliterations:

```{r}
ark <- Ark$new(alliterate = TRUE)

pseudonymize(1:12, .ark = ark)
```
