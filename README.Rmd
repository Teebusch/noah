`noah` (**no** **a**nimals were **h**armed) generates pseudonyms that are 
delightful and easy to remember. Instead of cryptic alphanumeric IDs, noah 
produces anonymous animals such as the *Likeable Leech* or the 
*Proud Chickadee*.

## Installation

You can install the development version of noah from [Github](/https://github.com/Teebusch/noah) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/dplyr")
```

## Usage

The fastest way to create pseudonyms with `noah` is to use the `pseudonymize()`
function. Here we use the diabetic retinopathy dataset from the `survival` 
package.

```{r include=FALSE}
diabetic <- dplyr::as_tibble(survival::diabetic)
```

```{r example-pseudonymize}
library(dplyr)
library(noah)

diabetic %>% 
  mutate(pseudonym = pseudonymize(id)) %>% 
  relocate(pseudonym)
```
Internally, `pseudonymize` uses an object of class `Ark`. Tha ark acts like a 
pseudonym dictionary: it keeps track of the pseudonyms that have already been 
used and makes sure that the same input is always assigned the same pseudonym. 
We can use this to ensure that the same case is assigned the same pseudonym
across multiple data sets:

```{r example-ark}
ark <- Ark$new()

# split dataset into left and right eye and pseudonymize separately
diabetic_left <- diabetic %>% 
  filter(eye == "left") %>% 
  mutate(pseudonym = pseudonymize(id, .ark = ark))

diabetic_right <- diabetic %>% 
  filter(eye == "right") %>% 
  mutate(pseudonym = pseudonymize(id, .ark = ark))

# reunite the data sets again
bind_rows(diabetic_left, diabetic_right) %>% 
  relocate(pseudonym) %>% 
  arrange(id)
```
