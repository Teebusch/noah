Description: Noah generates pseudonyms that are delightful and easy to remember.
    It creates adorable anonymous animals like the Likeable Leech and the 
    Proud Chickadee. A unique pseudonym can be created for every unique element
    in a vector or row in a data frame. Pseudomyms can be customized and 
    tracked over time, so that the same input is always assigned the same 
    pseudonym.
