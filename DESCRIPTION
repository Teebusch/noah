Description: Generate pseudonymous animal names that are delightful and easy to 
    remember like the Likable Leech and the Proud Chickadee. A unique pseudonym 
    can be created for every unique element in a vector or row in a data frame. 
    Pseudonyms can be customized and tracked over time, so that the same input 
    is always assigned the same pseudonym.
