\title{Generates a function that provides lazy number generation from a random
permutation of integers 1 to n without repetition. The numbers are generated
using the Fisher-Yates algorithm and run length encoding (RLE) is used to
keep memory use for the storage of used/available numbers minimal.}
\usage{
random_permutation(n)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Upper limit for random numbers (inclusive).}
}
\value{
A function \code{f(m)} that returns \code{m} random numbers from the random
permutation of integers 1 to n without repetition,. If all available
numbers 1 to n have been returned but more are requested, the function throws
an error.
}
